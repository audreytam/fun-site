            All About Cool Cat:
        </h3>
        <p>
            <em>Cool Cat Saves the Kids</em> is quite possibly the coolest movie you will ever see. It has a great message for kids about how to address bullying! I have only seen videos clips of this movie and I am in shock of how amazing it is, given the budget. I think that it is a spectacular motion picture that all people must see <strong>AT LEAST</strong> once in their lifetime. After hearing Cool Cat's persuaive thoughts on gun control and careful deliberation, I have decided to endorse Cool Cat in his presidential campaign. Thank you director Derick Savage, very cool!
